## Permissions

On Android versions prior to Android 6.0, wallabag requires the following permissions:
- Full Network Access.
- View Network Connections.
- Access geo-location.
- Read and write access to external storage.

The "Access geo-location" permission is only used when a building is being registered into the system so as to capture its latitude and longitude and is not utilised otherwise. The network access permissions are made use of for determining infomation on scanned IDs. The external storage permission is used to cache ID images for scraping information.
